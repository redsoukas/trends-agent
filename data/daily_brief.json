Robert Downey Jr. returns to the MCU, but not as the hero we knew...\n\nThe multiverse is collapsing. After the cataclysmic events of the Incursions, Earth-616 faces imminent destruction.

But this is not the Captain America that Sam Wilson remembers. The teaser shows Steve with a baby in his arms — the beginning of a new time loop that could destroy everything.\n\n The Fall of the Mutants: The X-Men enter their final battle. Magneto and Professor X are trying to protect the mansion from the Guardians, modified by Stark technology.\n\nDr. Doom without a Mask: The most anticipated moment is the meeting of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and Victor von Doom. The mask falls off, revealing Tony Sta",
