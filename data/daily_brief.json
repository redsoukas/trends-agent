Professor X. A mind Loki has never touched, yet one that feels ancient and burdened.\n\nThe image shifts again. The shattered helmet of Kang lies abandoned, defeated, erased by time itself.\n\nThen comes the moment Loki cannot look away from.\n\nA battlefield in ruins. Ever",

      "title": "Avengers: Doomsday – Loki Trailer | Loki Sees the Multiverse",
      "description": "This is a fan-made AI concept created by me, inspired by Avengers: Doomsday. It is a fictional interpretation and not an official trailer/scene/clip.\n\n👉 X-Men Trailer: https://youtu.be/rAjvLssfmPU \n👉 Thor begs Odin: https://youtu.be/J3yXj8-CDrI \n\nIf you use any part of this video in your edits, please credit my channel.\nPlease note that reuploads of this video without permission are not allowed.\n\nLoki sits upon his throne when the world around him fractures without warning.\n\nVisions begin to bleed into reality.\n\nFirst, Steve Rogers appears, worn and resolute, carrying the weight of impossible choices.\n\nThen his brother, Thor, kneeling in silence, praying to their father not for victory, but for peace.\n\nA stranger follows. Professor X. A mind Loki has never touched, yet one that feels ancient and burdened.\n\nThe image shifts again. The shattered helmet of Kang lies abandoned, defeated, erased by time itself.\n\nThen comes the moment Loki cannot look away from.\n\nA battlefield in ruins. Ever",
