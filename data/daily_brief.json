Blaire is an outspoken college student who often finds herself at odds with her more traditional-minded relatives.\n\n#Peacock #ted #tedSeason2 #OfficialTrailer\n\nPeacock is your go-to for hit movies, TV, live sports, and more.

Together they live in a working-class Boston home with John's parents (Matty and Susan) and cousin (Blaire). Matty is a blustering, blue-collar Bostonian who sees himself as the unequivocal boss of the house and frequently clashes with his liberal niece. Susan is kind, selfless, and almost pathologically sweet when it comes to caring for her family. Blaire is an outspoken college student who often finds herself at odds with her more traditional-minded relatives.\n\n#Peacock #ted #tedSeason2 #OfficialTrailer\n\nPeacock is your go-to for hit movies, TV, live sports, and more.
