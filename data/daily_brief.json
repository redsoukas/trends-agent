      "description": "I Beat Minecraft in a world that's COMPLETELY BEDROCK SUPERFLAT. This took over 2 months to record (mostly from overnight AFKing for pigs and wadnering traders lol) and about another month to edit. Although I got a lot of the editing done while AFKing in the world.\n\nNOTE: so far no one has, but you may have noticed at the end of the video my spawn point or world spawn is in the pig farm, even though earlier it was where the snow is. This is because when trying to spawn pigs earlier I did a ton of experiments and I thought one of the problems was my world just couldn't spawn passive mobs, so I copied the world's blocks over to a new world as a solution. This changed the spawnpoint as I didn't paste the blocks in the perfect same spot coordinate wise as the original world. However I wasn't even right and it ended up just being bunnies stopping pigs from spawning 😂\n\n\nHost a Server and get 25% off your first month with code: BEPPO: https://wisehosting.com/BEPPO/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n-Patreon: ht",

      "description": "I Beat Minecraft in a world that's COMPLETELY BEDROCK SUPERFLAT. This took over 2 months to record (mostly from overnight AFKing for pigs and wadnering traders lol) and about another month to edit. Although I got a lot of the editing done while AFKing in the world.\n\nNOTE: so far no one has, but you may have noticed at the end of the video my spawn point or world spawn is in the pig farm, even though earlier it was where the snow is. This is because when trying to spawn pigs earlier I did a ton of experiments and I thought one of the problems was my world just couldn't spawn passive mobs, so I copied the world's blocks over to a new world as a solution. This changed the spawnpoint as I didn't paste the blocks in the perfect same spot coordinate wise as the original world. However I wasn't even right and it ended up just being bunnies stopping pigs from spawning 😂\n\n\nHost a Server and get 25% off your first month with code: BEPPO: https://wisehosting.com/BEPPO/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n-Patreon: ht",
