The film unleashes a blood-soaked, high-octane horror-action-comedy in which a young woman must survive the night at the Virgil, a demonic cult’s mysterious and twisted death-trap of a lair, before becoming their next offering in a uniquely brazen, big screen battle of epic kills and wickedly dark humor.\n\nTHEY WILL KILL YOU stars Zazie Beetz, Myha’La, Paterson Joseph, Tom Felton, Heather Graham, and Patricia Arquette.\n\nDirected by Kirill Sokolov and written by Sokolov & Alex Litvak, the film is produced by Andy Muschietti, Barbara Muschietti and Dan Kagan, and executive produced by Russell Ackerman, John Schoenfelder, Carl Hampe, Litvak and Sokolov. \n\nBehind the camera, Sokolov is joined by director of photography Isaac Bauman, production designer Jeremy Reed, editor Luke Doolan, costume designer Neil McClean and visual effects supervisor Marc Smith.

      "description": "I Beat Minecraft in a world that's COMPLETELY BEDROCK SUPERFLAT. This took over 2 months to record (mostly from overnight AFKing for pigs and wadnering traders lol) and about another month to edit. Although I got a lot of the editing done while AFKing in the world.\n\nNOTE: so far no one has, but you may have noticed at the end of the video my spawn point or world spawn is in the pig farm, even though earlier it was where the snow is. This is because when trying to spawn pigs earlier I did a ton of experiments and I thought one of the problems was my world just couldn't spawn passive mobs, so I copied the world's blocks over to a new world as a solution. This changed the spawnpoint as I didn't paste the blocks in the perfect same spot coordinate wise as the original world. However I wasn't even right and it ended up just being bunnies stopping pigs from spawning 😂\n\n\nHost a Server and get 25% off your first month with code: BEPPO: https://wisehosting.com/BEPPO/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n-Patreon: ht",

This took over 2 months to record (mostly from overnight AFKing for pigs and wadnering traders lol) and about another month to edit. Although I got a lot of the editing done while AFKing in the world.\n\nNOTE: so far no one has, but you may have noticed at the end of the video my spawn point or world spawn is in the pig farm, even though earlier it was where the snow is. This is because when trying to spawn pigs earlier I did a ton of experiments and I thought one of the problems was my world just couldn't spawn passive mobs, so I copied the world's blocks over to a new world as a solution. This changed the spawnpoint as I didn't paste the blocks in the perfect same spot coordinate wise as the original world. However I wasn't even right and it ended up just being bunnies stopping pigs from spawning 😂\n\n\nHost a Server and get 25% off your first month with code: BEPPO: https://wisehosting.com/BEPPO/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n-Patreon: ht",
