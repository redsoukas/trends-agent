      "description": "This is a fan-made AI concept created by me, inspired by Avengers: Doomsday. It is a fictional interpretation and not an official trailer/scene/clip.\n\n👉 Steve Rogers Teaser: https://youtu.be/-pqDaCYmAVo \n👉 Thor begs Odin: https://youtu.be/J3yXj8-CDrI \n\nIf you use any part of this video in your edits, please credit my channel.\nPlease note that reuploads of this video without permission are not allowed.\n\nThe X-Men stand on the brink of extinction. Magneto and Professor X both feel it, the end is coming.\n\nBut the real question isn’t how it ends… It’s what comes after.\n\nFrom the pages of the comics, the Sentinels rise once more, not as weapons of control, but as instruments of erasure. A future designed to leave nothing behind.\n\nAnd beyond the machines, another shadow grows. While the world watches the Sentinels, Doctor Doom prepares his own endgame.\n\nExtinction was never the final threat. What follows it might be worse.\n\n#AvengersDoomsday #XMen #Magneto #Cyclops #ProfessorX #DoomsdayTrail",

Magneto and Professor X both feel it, the end is coming.\n\nBut the real question isn’t how it ends… It’s what comes after.\n\nFrom the pages of the comics, the Sentinels rise once more, not as weapons of control, but as instruments of erasure. A future designed to leave nothing behind.\n\nAnd beyond the machines, another shadow grows. While the world watches the Sentinels, Doctor Doom prepares his own endgame.\n\nExtinction was never the final threat. What follows it might be worse.\n\n#AvengersDoomsday #XMen #Magneto #Cyclops #ProfessorX #DoomsdayTrail",
