In this version, Jolie portrays Medusa as a hauntingly beautiful and angry woman, a priestess punished by Athena for crimes she did not commit; her transformation into the Gorgon, instead of a form of divine punishment for the crimes she committed, is a result of her being a victim, and Athena's refusal to hold herself accountable for the crime she committed against Medusa. In addition, Keanu Reeves portrays Poseidon with the same level of charming evil that he has portrayed in other roles as the god responsible for Medusa's transformation due to his assault on Athena in her temple and the fact that he has no responsibility for the actions that lead to Medusa's t",

Campbell is 50-year-old Val, a devoted wife and stay-at-home mom, who is eager to reignite the spark in her marriage when her youngest child leaves for college. Grappling with empty-nest feelings, loneliness and growing emotional distance from her husband Ross (Russell Hornsby), Val begins to realize that her marriage and the woman she once was, may be slipping away. A spontaneous escape to New Orleans to support her pregnant daughter, Kayla (Zing Ashford), awakens long-buried dreams and passions and introduces her to Peter Mosley (Mekhi Phifer), a handsome and charismatic photographer who sees her in ways she has forgotten to see herself.  Reawakening her artistic spirit and rediscovering her worth, Val must face a life-altering question: is it ever too late to choose yourself and the love you truly deserve? 'Mary J.
