These are my First 100 Days as King of the Unstable SMP.  \n\nUnstable SMP:\n➜ ‪  ‪ @wemmbumc \n➜ ‪  ‪ @FlameFragsMC \n➜ ‪   @Spokeishere \n➜ ‪  ‪ @ParrotX2  \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @TheobaldTheBird @fymada @HoraceMinecraft @dragon_mc_ @lezywezy @4CVIT @LettuceK \n\nOriginal Song by @tsynphonia \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!",
